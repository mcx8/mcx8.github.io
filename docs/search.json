You can’t see it but the fountain is a sculpture of a head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/12/2023 We went to Tohono Chul and it was a wonderful time :) There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/19/2023 A Queen butterfly (Danaus gillipus) snacking on some flower outside the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library. And no I don’t know what flower that is at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/16/2023 I think my boyfriend (Ethan) takes very nice pictures so I will include this very cool bee he sent me as well. Maybe it’s a wasp though, who knows. (It really is actually a Yellowjacket though, Vespula or Dolichovespula spp.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8/20/2023 One of Arizona’s many sunsets! More commonly observed during the summer monsoon season when mother nature takes a look at your oven and wonders what it feels like in there. Also because of certain atmospheric conditions."

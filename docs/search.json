That’s because of the dark margin and pale interior… or so he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3/9/2024 (Spring Break) I spent a lot of time running after unknown white butterflies (two types – one with a red stripe and another with black spots). But thankfully this Empress Leilia (Asterocampa leilia) let me take it home for our collaborative bug collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3/9/2024 (Spring Break) We went hiking at Tumamoc Hill (Tucson, AZ) the day before, and today we decided to check out Pima Canyon… which was absolutely beautiful! Especially since it had been raining the days before. I think this is my favorite hike in Tucson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/14/2023 Saw this Urbane Digger Bee (Anthophora urbana) happily sipping some breakfast while I was on my way to the library for a meeting. It’s carrying a good stash of pollen too, maybe they’re having a hive party later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/12/2023 Ethan actually does take very cool bee pictures. This little one (which is the Western Honey Bee, Apis mellifera) is drinking from a fountain. You can’t see it but the fountain is a sculpture of a head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/12/2023 We went to Tohono Chul (Tucson, AZ) and it was a wonderful time :) There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/19/2023 A Queen Butterfly (Danaus gillipus) snacking on some flower outside the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library. And no I don’t know what flower that is at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/16/2023 I think my boyfriend (Ethan) takes very nice pictures so I will include this very cool bee he sent me as well. Maybe it’s a wasp though, who knows. (It really is actually a Yellowjacket though, Vespula or Dolichovespula spp.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8/20/2023 One of Arizona’s many sunsets! More commonly observed during the summer monsoon season when mother nature takes a look at your oven and wonders what it feels like in there. Also because of certain atmospheric conditions."

    "text": "Hi! I am a postgraduate researcher for Dr. Kathleen Prudic at the University of Arizona and I will be attaining my M.S. in Statistics at Oregon State University starting Fall 2024. My projects at the moment include modeling the distribution of Centris pallida and its hostplants in the Southwest United States, assisting in the NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution grant, and other assorted activities. In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, playing tennis, and spending time with my partner.\n\n\n\nB.S. Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (minor: Mathematics)\nUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, AZ | May 2023\n\n\n\n\nMy father’s side of the family has an agricultural background based in Nueva Ecija, Philippines — where my grandfather founded the Philippine Carabao Center and our relatives have been growing rice fields. Having spent my childhood in both the United States and the northern part of the Philippines, I grew up with an appreciation of both countries as well as an interest in helping optimize farming while (more recently) finding a balance with sustainable and environmental-friendly practices. My interest in agriculture has also been influenced by all the times my father took me with him to work, where I got to watch him take care of plants in both heavily misted greenhouses and under the fluorescent lights of labs.\nI have had the opportunity to work in various field, lab, and computer-oriented jobs, which has given me a broad background in research methods and work atmospheres. I have especially enjoyed research in Integrated Pest Management (IPM), ecological modeling, and those that required knowledge of programming in R/RStudio. After pursuing graduate studies, I hope to pursue a career under the USDA or in Extension that unifies all of those disciplines."

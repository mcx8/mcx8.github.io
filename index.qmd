## hi there!

This is a website about myself by myself. Not sure how you got here but it is still in the making as you will see.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## education

**B.S. Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (minor: Mathematics)**

University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ \| May 2023

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## background

I have had the opportunity to work in various field, lab, and computer-oriented jobs, which has given me a broad background in research methods and work atmospheres. I have especially enjoyed research in Integrated Pest Management (IPM), ecological modeling, and those that required knowledge of programming in R/RStudio.

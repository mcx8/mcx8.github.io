## bugs & other outdoorsy things

![**3/9/2024 (Spring Break)** There's Ethan in the background admiring this rugged butterfly, which I found out from some iNaturalist guy is an "early spring form" of Empress Leilia. That's because of the dark margin and pale interior... or so he says.](images/IMG_9.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (Spring Break)** I spent a lot of time running after unknown white butterflies (two types -- one with a red stripe and another with black spots). But thankfully this Empress Leilia (*Asterocampa leilia*) let me take it home for our collaborative bug collection.](images/IMG_8.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (Spring Break)** We went hiking at Tumamoc Hill (Tucson, AZ) the day before, and today we decided to check out Pima Canyon... which was absolutely beautiful! Especially since it had been raining the days before. I think this is my favorite hike in Tucson.](images/IMG_7.jpg)

![**11/14/2023** Saw this Urbane Digger Bee (*Anthophora urbana*) happily sipping some breakfast while I was on my way to the library for a meeting. It's carrying a good stash of pollen too, maybe they're having a hive party later.](images/IMG_6.jpg)

![**10/12/2023** Ethan actually does take very cool bee pictures. This little one (which is the Western Honey Bee, *Apis mellifera*) is drinking from a fountain. You can't see it but the fountain is a sculpture of a head.](images/IMG_5.jpg)

![**10/12/2023** We went to Tohono Chul (Tucson, AZ) and it was a wonderful time :) There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though.](images/IMG_4.jpg)

![**9/19/2023** A Queen Butterfly (*Danaus gillipus*) snacking on some flower outside the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library. And no I don't know what flower that is at the moment.](images/IMG_3.jpg)

![**9/16/2023** I think my boyfriend (Ethan) takes very nice pictures so I will include this very cool bee he sent me as well. Maybe it's a wasp though, who knows. (It really is actually a Yellowjacket though, *Vespula* or *Dolichovespula* spp.)](images/IMG_2.jpg)

![**8/20/2023** One of Arizona's many sunsets! More commonly observed during the summer monsoon season when mother nature takes a look at your oven and wonders what it feels like in there. Also because of certain atmospheric conditions.](images/IMG_1.jpg)

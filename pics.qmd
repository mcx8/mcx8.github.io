![**10/12/2023** Ethan actually does take very cool bee pictures. This little one (which is the western honey bee, *Apis mellifera*) is drinking from a fountain. You can't see it but the fountain is a sculpture of a head.](images/IMG_3168.jpg)

![**10/12/2023** We went to Tohono Chul and it was a wonderful time :) There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though.](images/IMG_8649.jpg)

![**9/19/2023** A Queen butterfly (*Danaus gillipus*) snacking on some flower outside the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library. And no I don't know what flower that is at the moment.](images/IMG_7969.jpg)

![**9/16/2023** I think my boyfriend (Ethan) takes very nice pictures so I will include this very cool bee he sent me as well. Maybe it's a wasp though, who knows. (It really is actually a Yellowjacket though, *Vespula* or *Dolichovespula* spp.)](images/IMG_0957.jpg)

![**8/20/2023** One of Arizona's many sunsets! More commonly observed during the summer monsoon season when mother nature takes a look at your oven and wonders what it feels like in there. Also because of certain atmospheric conditions.](images/IMG_7569.jpg)

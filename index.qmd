Hi! I am a postgraduate researcher for Dr. Kathleen Prudic at the University of Arizona and I will be attaining my M.S. in Statistics at Oregon State University starting Fall 2024. My projects at the moment include modeling the distribution of *Centris pallida* and its hostplants in the Southwest United States, assisting in the NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution grant, and other assorted activities. In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, playing tennis, and spending time with my partner.

## background

My father's side of the family has an agricultural background based in Nueva Ecija, Philippines --- where my grandfather founded the Philippine Carabao Center and our relatives have been growing rice fields. Having spent my childhood in both the United States and the northern part of the Philippines, I grew up with an appreciation of both countries as well as an interest in helping optimize farming while (more recently) finding a balance with sustainable and environmental-friendly practices. My interest in agriculture has also been influenced by all the times my father took me with him to work, where I got to watch him take care of plants in both heavily misted greenhouses and under the fluorescent lights of labs.

I have had the opportunity to work in various field, lab, and computer-oriented jobs, which has given me a broad background in research methods and work atmospheres. I have especially enjoyed research in Integrated Pest Management (IPM), ecological modeling, and those that required knowledge of programming in R/RStudio. After pursuing graduate studies, I hope to pursue a career under the USDA or in Extension that unifies all of those disciplines.
